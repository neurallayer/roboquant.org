You can easily plot the captured metrics during a run using the MetricChart. Not only can it plot a metric that was captured during a single run, it also knows how to plot a metric over multiple runs.

== Walk Forward
Plot a metric during a walk-forward test to provide insight into the performance of the strategy during different timeframes. The walk-forward test involves dividing the historical data into multiple timeframes or "windows," and using each timeframe to test the performance of the strategy.

Here we plot the account equity (= cash + positions) and that provides insights how a strategy performs during different timeframes. Clearly we can see that the strategy wasn't profitable during every timeframe.

== Monte Carlo
An even more extensive back-test is to run the experiment over randomly sampled timeframes of a fixed duration. In this example we selected the duration to be 250 trading days. We then plot the results of all samples and this provide a good view of the distribution of the profit/loss a strategy could generate over 250 days timeframe.
