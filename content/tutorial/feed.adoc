== What is a feed
A feed is responsible for delivering the data that is needed to test and run strategies. There are no restrictions on the type of data that a `Feed` can emit. It can be as simple as stock prices or as complex as satellite images. A `Feed` is used to deliver historic and live data.

A feed wraps its information in an `Event` and puts that `Event` on an `EventChannel`. This is all done asynchronously from rest of the trading logic. And although an `EventChannel` is used to deliver the events, this channel is normally only accessed by internal _roboquant_ logic. A xref:strategy.adoc[strategy] will be passed just the `Event` object.

To read more about why _roboquant_ has selected this event-driven approach, read this xref:../background/features.adoc[introduction to event-driven software].

== Event
An `Event` instance contains all the data that happens at a certain point in <<Time>>. It contains the following two attributes

. The `time` attribute when the information within the event became available.
. The list of all the <<Action>> instances at that time. This can be a mixed list of classes that implement the `Action` interface. A single `Event` can contain prices, satellite images and social media news at the same time.

Events are always expected to be delivered in chronological order.

=== Time
The time in an event is of the Java type `java.time.Instant`. So they can be easily processed without having to worry about timezones. When a feed delivers events, they are always in chronological order.

****
It is very important that the time in the event reflects when the actions in that same event became available, not when they happened. Typically, there is some delay between when something occurred and when it is published. An event should reflect the published time.

For example when you want to use unemployment numbers as part of your feed, you should use the time when they are published and you have access to them, not the last day of the period they cover. Otherwise, your strategy is looking into the future during back testing and can make decisions based on information it will never have in live trading.
****

=== Action
Action is an abstraction for any type of information that can be made available in an <<Event>>. An action ranges from price actions, like price-bars and order-book snapshots, to social media content or images.

There is no commonality between actions, and you can add any type of action to the platform. The only requirements is that they implement the empty interface `Action`. It is up to the strategy to filter for the action types it is interested in.

For example if your strategy would require `PriceBar` (candlestick) data, you could use the following pattern to filter this type:

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=event]
----

There are also a few helper methods in the `Event` class to make access to prices more convenient, since these are of interest to many strategies:

[source, kotlin, indent=0]

include::{sourcefile}[tag=priceaction]

== Included Feeds
Roboquant includes several `Feed` implementations out of the box:

* `CSVFeed` that can process CSV files stored somewhere on your local machine.
* `AvroFeed` that can process an Avro files stored somewhere on your local machine.
* `RandomWalkFeed` that (as the name suggests) generates random price actions for random assets.
* Integration with third party data providers that make their data available through an API. See also the xref:integration.adoc[integration documentation].


[#_custom_feeds]
== Custom Feeds
If you have a data source that is not yet covered by _roboquant_, you can implement your own `Feed`. The main method to implement is the `play` method that will put the available events on the `EventChannel`.

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=interface]
----

The following dummy implementation of the `play` method sends out 100 empty events, empty meaning an event without any actions included. When the EventChannel is full, the `channel.send` method will be blocking.

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=play]
----

== CSV Feed
CSV files are one of the most common used file formats for storing historic price data. However, since there is no standard defined, they differ a lot depending on where you downloaded them from. Additionally, they often lack some required meta-data, like the currency of the price or the exchange where they are traded.

The `CSVFeed` class in _roboquant_ offers several configuration options to cater to these differences, allowing you to parse almost any CSV files found on the internet.

=== Basic usage
The simplest usage is to provide the directory that contains the CSV files and the CSVFeed will try to parse them based on defaults and the content it finds.

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=basic]
----

=== Configuration
Since the format of CSV files differs a lot, the CSVFeed allows for a lot of configuration to cater to this.

The following properties determine how the CSV files are parsed

[source, properties]
----
asset.type = STOCK
asset.exchange = AEB
asset.currency = EUR

file.extension = csv
file.skip = ABC.csv XYZ.csv
----

=== Memory Constraints
The default `CSVFeed` loads all the data found in all the files into memory during initialization. The benefit is that after initialization the CSVFeed is very fast when used in back tests. And since you reuse the feed in concurrent back-tests, this becomes even more important when doing extensive back testing.

However, a possible downside is memory usage when working in a memory-constrained environment. So there is also a CSV Feed implementation that only reads the data when required. This is substantial slower, but consumes a lot less memory. It supports the same configuration, the only difference is that you need to use `LazyCSVFeed` instead of the regular `CSVFeed`

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=lazy]
----

TIP: Convert the CSV files to an AvroFeed, that way you have the best of both worlds: low memory consumption and high performance. See <<Convert to an AvroFeed>> on how to do that.


== Avro Feed
Apache Avroâ„¢ is a data serialization system. Avro provides:

* Rich data structures.
* A compact, fast, binary data format.
* A container file, to store persistent data.

Avro files make it easy to store large amount of data in a single file and efficiently use it during back testing. The AvroFeed implementation of _roboquant_ only loads data in memory when it is required, so very large datasets can be used without having to worry about memory issues.

Also since the Avro Feed uses a single file, it is easier to distribute it than for example directories full of CSV files.

=== Using an AvroFeed
Using any compatible Avro file as a feed is straightforward. You just provide the file location to the constructor as a parameter and the feed will be ready to use.

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=avro]
----

A single feed can contain mixed price actions if required, so you can have Trade Prices and Price Bars in the same feed.

[#_convert_to_an_avrofeed]
=== Convert to an AvroFeed
You can also convert other feeds into Avro files that you can later use for back-testing. This works with both historic data feeds and live data feeds. The current limitation is that it only works with price actions and not other type of actions like image data or social media posts.

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=avrocapture]
----

TIP: If you work a lot with directories full of CSV files, you can convert them to a single Avro file and use that from then on (using the above code snippet as an example). This is both faster and has lower memory consumption.

The nice thing is that the recording also works with live feeds. So you can record a live feed for a specified timeframe and then use it from then on in your own back test.

The following example shows how you can record 4 hours worth of Bitcoin price-bars from the Binance exchange.

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=avrocapturelive]
----

=== Default AvroFeeds
Roboquant comes with a few default AvroFeeds. The main benefit is that you can quickly test if your code is working without having to download or set up your own feeds. There are two feeds available:

1. A feed with daily `PriceBar` market data for the S&P 500 stocks for the last few years
2. A feed with a few minutes of price quotes, again for the S&P 500 stocks

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=predefined]
----

In the future there will be more default AvroFeeds that you can use, depending on the feedback from the community. Likely candidates that are currently missing are FOREX feeds and cryptocurrency feeds.

WARNING: These default feeds should not be relied on for serious back testing. They just serve to quickly run a back test and see if your strategy and policy are behaving as expected.
