== Two approaches
There are two different ways to install and use _roboquant_:

[.float-group]
--
image::jupyter-lab.png[width="500", float="left"]
Interactively in a *Jupyter Notebook*. If you want to be up and running quickly, this is the easiest approach. Additionally, you get many charts out-of-the-box that help you to understand how the strategy is performing.

{empty} +

[.float-group]
--
image::idea.png[width="500", float="right"]
As a library in your *standalone Kotlin or Java application*. If you plan to develop large and complex trading strategies, this is a good approach since you'll have the full power of an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA at your disposal.

== Run Jupyter Notebook
If you don't want to install anything on your local machine, you can try any of the included notebooks right now by clicking on one of the two following badges:

. Jupyter Classic: image:https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[Binder,link=https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=tree/notebooks/,window=_blank]
. Jupyter Lab: image:https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[Binder,link=https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks/,window=_blank]

If you have already Docker installed on your local machine, all it takes is a single command to have a fully functional Jupyter Notebook environment with _roboquant_ available that is ready to use.

[source,shell]
----
docker run -p 8888:8888 docker.io/roboquant/jupyter
----
By default, this will start a new Jupyter-Lab environment. The installation comes with several how-to notebooks included that demonstrate how to develop and run your own strategies.

The following startup command has two additional features:

1. it disposes of the container as soon as you stop the container (the `--rm` option)
2. it uses a fixed token, so you don't have to look at the output to find out the token to use.

[source, shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_TOKEN="my-secret" docker.io/roboquant/jupyter
----

If you don't have Docker yet installed on your computer, check out https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker get started^] and download Docker Desktop from there. If you are running Linux, then your distribution likely already has Docker or Podman included.

=== AWS SageMaker
The AWS SageMaker notebook instances don't have Kotlin support enabled by default. But there is an easy way to add it the first time an instance is created. You can add a `lifecycle` script that will be run when the environment is created and in our case adds the Kotlin kernel.

When creating a new notebook instance from the SageMaker menu, open the `additional configuration` option and select `create new lifecycle configuration` from the lifecycle configuration dropdown. Then add the following snippet to the `Start notebook` tab.

[source,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash
set -eux

# This script installs the Kotlin kernel before starting the notebook
sudo -u ec2-user -i <<'EOF'
source /home/ec2-user/anaconda3/bin/activate JupyterSystemEnv
pip install kotlin-jupyter-kernel
source /home/ec2-user/anaconda3/bin/deactivate
EOF

----

This has been tested with the platform identifier set to "Amazon Linux 2/Jupyter Lab 3" and "Give users root access to the notebook" enabled (default).

== Install the _roboquant_ libraries
Just add `roboquant` as a dependency to your build tool, like Maven or Gradle. Regular versions of the Roboquant modules are published to Maven Central and snapshots are published to OSS Sonatype (https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots).

The latest available versions:

- regular release: image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant[Maven Central]
- snapshot release: image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)]

The following modules are available for inclusion in your application:

* `roboquant`: the core module of the platform
* `roboquant-crypto`: support for many of today's popular crypto exchanges
* `roboquant-extra`: integrations with 3rd party brokers and market data providers
* `roboquant-ibkr`: integration with Interactive Brokers
* `roboquant-ta`: over 150 technical analysis indicators and strategies
* `roboquant-jupyter` additional Jupyter Notebook functionality like charting

=== Maven
Add the following snippet to your pom.xml file in the dependencies section:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.roboquant</groupId>
    <artifactId>roboquant</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

or if you want to create your own new algo-trading project, you can run the Maven Archetype that is available for _roboquant_:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate                          \
-DarchetypeGroupId=org.roboquant                \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=roboquant-quickstart      \
-DarchetypeVersion=1.1.0                        \
-DgroupId=org.mydomain                          \
-DartifactId=myapp                              \
-Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

This will result in a fully functional Kotlin Maven project with a small sample strategy, that is ready to be imported an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA.

=== Gradle
Include the following line in your build.gradle script:

[source, groovy]
----
implementation group: 'org.roboquant', name: 'roboquant', version: 'VERSION'
----

== Building from source
First start with cloning the _roboquant_ GitHub repository to your local disk. The quickest way to be up and running is then to install IntelliJ IDEA (either the free community edition or the paid Ultimate version) and open the directory you just cloned. IntelliJ IDEA will recognize it as Kotlin/Maven project, and you can build it and run test directly from the IDE.

_Roboquant_ uses a directory setup that is similar to most other Kotlin projects:

[]
----
root
    roboquant
        src/main/kotlin
        src/test/kotlin
    roboquant-extra
        src/main/kotlin
        src/test/kotlin
----

All source code is written in Kotlin, so there are no Java or other language source files. Roboquant uses Maven for the build process and includes a Maven wrapper (mvnw) to ensure optimal compatability between environments. Building the libraries locally is as easy as running a single command:

[source, shell]
----
./mvnw install
----

The build and install is tested using the JDK 17 runtime, however the generated libraries are targeted against JDK 11 in order to provide better compatibility for projects that still use older versions of the JDK. JDK versions before 11 are not supported.

The following script shows how to get everything build based on a clean Ubuntu 22.04 installation (like the one you can select when starting an AWS EC2 instance)

[source, shell]
----
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y git openjdk-17-jre-headless
git clone https://github.com/neurallayer/roboquant.git
cd roboquant
./mvnw install
----

When the `./wvnw install` process has successfully finished, you should see something like this:
[source]
----
[INFO] roboquant parent ................................... SUCCESS [  1.618 s]
[INFO] roboquant .......................................... SUCCESS [  6.768 s]
[INFO] roboquant ta ....................................... SUCCESS [  3.868 s]
[INFO] roboquant jupyter .................................. SUCCESS [  2.503 s]
[INFO] roboquant extra .................................... SUCCESS [  2.838 s]
[INFO] roboquant crypto ................................... SUCCESS [  3.213 s]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
----


TIP: If you plan to make regular changes and updates to the _roboquant_ source code, checkout the https://github.com/apache/maven-mvnd[Maven Daemon] project that provides faster builds. Additionally, you can set the Kotlin incremental compiler property to true (in the main `pom.xml`).

== Interactive Brokers
Unfortunately we are not allowed to redistribute the Interactive Brokers Java client, so you'll have to download the TwsApi.jar file yourself. You can download the stable version `10.19` from here: https://interactivebrokers.github.io and within the downloaded archive file you'll find the required `TwsApi.jar`.

Then install the jar file in your local Maven repository on your machine using the following command:

[source, shell]
----
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=TwsApi.jar -DgroupId=com.interactivebrokers -DartifactId=tws-api -Dversion=10.19 -Dpackaging=jar
----

If this artefact cannot be found in your local Maven repository during a build, the module `roboquant-ibkr` will automatically be skipped. So if you don't require integration with Interactive Brokers for your trading, you can skip this step altogether.
