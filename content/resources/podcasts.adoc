One of my favourite podcast about systematic trading. Every episode has a different trader as guest. The focus is on pragmatic topics that can be put directly to work in your own strategies.

Since there is often accompanying visual content, you might want to watch the episodes on their https://www.youtube.com/@BetterSystemTraderPodcast[YouTube channel] instead.

This podcast contains several episodes and interviews with professional algo traders. Especially the coverage of potential pitfalls of going live with fully automated trading systems might prove to be extra helpful and insightful.

All about rule based investment in the context of trend following strategies. There are some very experienced traders on this show, and they share a lot of useful tips and best practices.

The episodes with Rob Carver as guest are particular interesting since he is a retail algo-trader himself (but not yet using roboquant ;). An additional benefit for algo-traders is that most trend following strategies are not that difficult to translate into executable code.

One thing to keep in mind is that most presenters come from a CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) background, and as a result many of the covered assets are commodities and futures, and not individual stocks.

Provides good background information on trending financial topics. Besides providing excellent insights into these hot topics, I really enjoy the way it is presented with a good amount of dry English humor.

For example checkout this episode: https://podcasts.apple.com/nl/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313?i=1000518760107[The Bitcoin Green Revolution - Is Cathie Wood Right About Bitcoin?]

Explores systematic investment strategies, ranging from value to momentum and merger arbitrage to managed futures. Nice thing about this podcast is that there are many types of guests interviewed, ranging from traditional fund managers to retail crypto traders.
