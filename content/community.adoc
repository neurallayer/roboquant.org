_Roboquant_ has its own Discord server with various channels to discuss algo-trading in general and to get help in developing your own strategies using the _roboquant_ platform.

Since the _roboquant_ documentation is still lacking in certain areas, this is a great place to ask questions and find out more about the platform.
