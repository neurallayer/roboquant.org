# This property file contains configuration settings that will be made available to roboquant
# Many data feed providers and brokers require one or more keys to be able to access their APIs,
# and this is one of the ways to provide those credentials.
#
# If you store credentials in here, make sure other people don't have access to it and
# don't version control it to a public repo by mistake.
# One solution is to place this file at ~/.roboquant/.env

# Sample entry
# sample.public.key=some_key_value
# sample.secret.key=another_key_value

# Uncomment the following line and change the value for Alpha Vantage access
